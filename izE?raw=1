TITLE:		From Atari to Zelda: A History of Video Games
SHORT:		History of Video Games
DESCRIPTION:

    Video games have had a profound impact on not only the technology 
    industry but also modern society and culture.  Through directed 
    readings, weekly writing assignments, class presentations, and group 
    discussions, this course explores the history of video games and 
    examines their impact on a variety of social, ethical, and political 
    issues such as gun violence, diversity, addiction, piracy, and more.  
    In addition to discussing these topics, the class also explores 
    various video game development techniques and methods utilized to 
    create famous and popular games.  Students are expected to apply 
    this knowledge in two group projects: the first involves creating a 
    video game on a retro gaming platform while the second requires 
    re-creating a retro game on a modern platform.
